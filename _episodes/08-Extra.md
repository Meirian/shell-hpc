### What is SSH?

### Transferring files

##scp##

To copy a file, we specify the source and destination paths, either of which may include computer names. If we leave out a computer name, scp assumes we mean the machine weâ€™re running on.

##Wget##

Wget is a simple tool developed for the GNU Project that downloads files with the HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols. It is widely used by Unix-like users and is available with most Linux distributions.
